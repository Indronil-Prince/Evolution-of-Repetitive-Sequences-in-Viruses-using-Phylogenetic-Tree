# Evolution-of-Repetitive-Sequences-in-Viruses-using-Phylogenetic-Tree
Evolution of Repetitive Sequences in Viruses using Phylogenetic Tree


# Objectives

In this project, we will study the evolution of the most frequent 9-mers in coronaviruses as main tasks and other viruses as extra credits. You will calculate sequence similarity, build a rooted phylogenetic tree, reconstruct ancestral sequences for the most frequent 9-mers. You will also interpret the tree built for potentially new understanding of the evolution history of repetitive elements in viruses.
